# HW10

1.	Create a JSON formatted file called “entities.json” and place it in the “data” folder.  It will contain an array of 5 entities.  Each entity can be anything of your choice (i.e. dogs, flowers, cars, etc.).  For each entity, you will have a name, description, and a path to an image in your images folder.  You can include more properties if you like.

2.	For this assignment, you will use index.html from assignment HW6.

3.	Add a button titled “See my favorite things”.  When clicked the button will run the script to load entities.json file asynchronously on the web page.

4.	Parse all the fields and display them in a neat organized fashion
